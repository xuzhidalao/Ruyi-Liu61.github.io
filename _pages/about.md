My name is Dian Jiao and I am a third-year PhD student in Accounting at Columbia Business School. I am interested in investigating how the accounting information can shape the market efficiency and the role of disclosure and information intermediaries in the process. In my research, I apply both empirical and analytical methods, as well as recent advances in technology such as machine learning and textual analysis. 

Prior to joining CBS, I had served for two years as a quantitative researcher at Ruitian Capital, focusing on systematic quantimental equity stratgies based on statistical methods. I received M.S. in Financial Engineering from Columbia, and M.A. in Finance and B.S. in Applied Math from SJTU. 

Born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henan">Henan Province</a>, the birthplace of Chinese Civilization with over 3,200 years of recorded history, I enjoy history, Chinese poems, and Chinese calligraphy. Also, I am interested in climbing, basketball, table tennis, road cycling, swimming, and hiking.
